## About Me ðŸ’¬
<p align="center">
  I am in the process of changing careers and am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. I have always liked technology and due to lack of options I ended up not following this area and focusing my career on the area of â€‹â€‹Agricultural and Biological Sciences, but now at the age of 37, I have decided to go head first into the programming area.
